If you need _watch_ functionality, use [base-tasks](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/base-tasks) and [base-watch](https://github.com/node-base/base-watch).\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar Composer = require('composer');\n```\n\n## API\n\n### [.task](index.js#L62)\n\nRegister a new task with it's options and dependencies.\n\nDependencies may also be specified as a glob pattern. Be aware that\nthe order cannot be guarenteed when using a glob pattern.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `name` **{String}**: Name of the task to register\n* `options` **{Object}**: Options to set dependencies or control flow.\n* `options.deps` **{Object}**: array of dependencies\n* `options.flow` **{Object}**: How this task will be executed with it's dependencies (`series`, `parallel`, `settleSeries`, `settleParallel`)\n* `deps` **{String|Array|Function}**: Additional dependencies for this task.\n* `fn` **{Function}**: Final function is the task to register.\n* `returns` **{Object}**: Return the instance for chaining\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\n// register task \"site\" with composer\napp.task('site', ['styles'], function() {\n  return app.src('templates/pages/*.hbs')\n    .pipe(app.dest('_gh_pages'));\n});\n```\n\n### [.build](index.js#L119)\n\nBuild a task or array of tasks.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions. (Defaults to `[default]`).\n* `options` **{Object}**: Optional options object to merge onto each task's options when building.\n* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function to be called when all tasks are finished building.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\napp.build('default', function(err, results) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  console.log(results);\n});\n```\n\n### [.series](index.js#L186)\n\nCompose task or list of tasks into a single function that runs the tasks in series.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions.\n* `returns` **{Function}**: Composed function that may take a callback function.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\napp.task('foo', function(done) {\n  console.log('this is foo');\n  done();\n});\n\nvar fn = app.series('foo', function bar(done) {\n  console.log('this is bar');\n  done();\n});\n\nfn(function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  console.log('done');\n});\n//=> this is foo\n//=> this is bar\n//=> done\n```\n\n### [.parallel](index.js#L218)\n\nCompose task or list of tasks into a single function that runs the tasks in parallel.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions.\n* `returns` **{Function}**: Composed function that may take a callback function.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\napp.task('foo', function(done) {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    console.log('this is foo');\n    done();\n  }, 500);\n});\n\nvar fn = app.parallel('foo', function bar(done) {\n  console.log('this is bar');\n  done();\n});\n\nfn(function(err) {\n  if (err) return console.error(err);\n  console.log('done');\n});\n//=> this is bar\n//=> this is foo\n//=> done\n```\n\n## Task execution\n\nWhen an individual task is executed (or run), a new [Run](lib/run.js) instance is created with start, end, and duration information. This `run` object is emitted with [some events](#taskstarting) and also exposed on the `task` instance as the `.runInfo` property.\n\nThe `run` instance has the the following properties\n\n**.date**\n\nThe `.date` property is an object containing the `.start` and `.end` date timestamps created with `new Date()`.\n\n**.hr**\n\nThe `.hr` property is an object containing the `.start`, `.end` and `.duration` properties that are created by using `process.hrtime()`. These properties are the actual arrays returned from `process.hrtime()`.\nThere is also `.diff` and `.offset` computed properties that use the other properties to calculate the difference between `.start` and `.end` times (`.diff`) and the offset (error for time calculations) between the `.duration` and the `.diff` (this is usually very small).\n\n**.duration**\n\nThe `.duration` property is a computed property that uses [pretty-time](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/pretty-time) to format the `.hr.duration` value into a human readable format.\n\n## Events\n\n[composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer) is an event emitter that may emit the following events:\n\n### starting\n\nThis event is emitted when a `build` is starting.\n\nThe event emits 2 arguments, the current instance of [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer) as the `app` and an object containing the build runtime information.\n\n```js\napp.on('starting', function(app, build) {});\n```\n\n* `build` exposes a `.date` object that has a `.start` property containing the start time as a `Date` object.\n* `build` exposes a `.hr` object that has a `.start` property containing the start time as an `hrtime` array.\n\n### finished\n\nThis event is emitted when a `build` has finished.\n\nThe event emits 2 arguments, the current instance of [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer) as the `app` and an object containing the build runtime information.\n\n```js\napp.on('finished', function(app, build) {});\n```\n\n* `build` exposes a `.date` object that has `.start` and `.end` properties containing start and end times of the build as `Date` objects.\n* `build` exposes a `.hr` object that has `.start`, `.end`, `.duration`, and `.diff` properties containing timing information calculated using `process.hrtime`\n\n### error\n\nThis event is emitted when an error occurrs during a `build`.\nThe event emits 1 argument as an `Error` object containing additional information about the build and the task running when the error occurred.\n\n```js\napp.on('error', function(err) {});\n```\n\nAdditional properties:\n\n* `app`: current composer instance running the build\n* `build`: current build runtime information\n* `task`: current task instance running when the error occurred\n* `run`: current task runtime information\n\n### task:starting\n\nThis event is emitted when a task is starting.\nThe event emits 2 arguments, the current instance of the task object and an object containing the task runtime information.\n\n```js\napp.on('task:starting', function(task, run) {});\n```\n\nThe `run` parameter exposes:\n\n* `.date` **{Object}**: has a `.start` property containing the start time as a `Date` object.\n* `.hr` **{Object}**: has a `.start` property containing the start time as an `hrtime` array.\n\n### task:finished\n\nThis event is emitted when a task has finished.\n\nThe event emits 2 arguments, the current instance of the task object and an object containing the task runtime information.\n\n```js\napp.on('task:finished', function(task, run) {});\n```\n\nThe `run` parameter exposes:\n\n* `.date` **{Object}**: has a `.date` object that has `.start` and `.end` properties containing start and end times of the task as `Date` objects.\n* `run` **{Object}**: has an `.hr` object that has `.start`, `.end`, `.duration`, and `.diff` properties containing timing information calculated using `process.hrtime`\n\n### task:error\n\nThis event is emitted when an error occurrs while running a task.\nThe event emits 1 argument as an `Error` object containing additional information about the task running when the error occurred.\n\n```js\napp.on('task:error', function(err) {});\n```\n\n**Additional properties**\n\n* `task`: current task instance running when the error occurred\n* `run`: current task runtime information\n\n## History\n\n### v0.14.0\n\n* Updates [bach](https://github.com/gulpjs/bach) to `1.0.0`.\n* Errors emitted from inside a task now have the `'in task \"foo\":'` prefixed to the error message. [see issue #22](../../issues/22)\n* Expose `.runInfo` on the task object for use in event listeners and task functions.\n* Add `.duration` to the `.run/.runInfo` object that shows the duration in a human friendly format. This will also show the current duration from the time the task started to the time it's called if used inside a task function. [see issue #23](../../issues/23)\n\n```js\napp.task('foo', function(cb) {\n  console.log(this.runInfo.duration);\n});\n```\n\n### v0.13.0\n\n* Skip tasks by setting the `options.skip` option to the name of the task or an array of task names.\n* Making additional `err` properties non-enumerable to cut down on error output.\n\n### v0.12.0\n\n* You can no longer get a task from the `.task()` method by passing only the name. Instead do `var task = app.tasks[name];`\n* Passing only a name and no dependencies to `.task()` will result in a `noop` task being created.\n* `options` may be passed to `.build()`, `.series()` and `.parallel()`\n* `options` passed to `.build()` will be merged onto task options before running the task.\n* Skip tasks by setting their `options.run` option to `false`.\n\n### v0.11.3\n\n* Allow passing es2015 javascript generator functions to `.task()`.\n\n### v0.11.2\n\n* Allow using glob patterns for task dependencies.\n\n### v0.11.0\n\n* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed `.watch()`. Watch functionality can be added to [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) applications using [base-watch](https://github.com/node-base/base-watch).\n\n### v0.10.0\n\n* Removes `session`.\n\n### v0.9.0\n\n* Use `default` when no tasks are passed to `.build()`.\n\n### v0.8.4\n\n* Ensure task dependencies are unique.\n\n### v0.8.2\n\n* Emitting `task` when adding a task through `.task()`\n* Returning task when calling `.task(name)` with only a name.\n\n### v0.8.0\n\n* Emitting `task:*` events instead of generic `*` events. See [event docs](#events) for more information.\n\n### v0.7.0\n\n* No longer returning the current task when `.task()` is called without a name.\n* Throwing an error when `.task()` is called without a name.\n\n### v0.6.0\n\n* Adding properties to `err` instances and emitting instead of emitting multiple parameters.\n* Adding series and parallel flows/methods.\n\n### v0.5.0\n\n* **BREAKING CHANGE** Renamed `.run()` to `.build()`\n\n### v0.4.2\n\n* `.watch` returns an instance of `FSWatcher`\n\n### v0.4.1\n\n* Currently running task returned when calling `.task()` without a name.\n\n### v0.4.0\n\n* Add session-cache to enable per-task data contexts.\n\n### v0.3.0\n\n* Event bubbling/emitting changed.\n\n### v0.1.0\n\n* Initial release.\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [assemble](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemble): Get the rocks out of your socks!
